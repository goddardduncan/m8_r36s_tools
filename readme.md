There are a suite of tools here to make and upload m8 sample kits to the SD card of a teensy m8 tracker using an R36s.  Using them you can:

-Browse a library of samples, listen to them, and add them to a saved list of the ones you like
-Merge these wavs and slice cue points into them into a saved file
-Upload this file to your SD card to use on your M8 tracker
-Another app allows you to download files from https://m8slice.glitch.me that have been sliced already (you still need to upload them)

Check each sub folder for a description of each tool + code + executables (in build folders).
To make the most of this, you need a USB C to microSD card reader dongle for your OTG on your R36s.
To download files for m8slice.glitch.me you'll need to have an active internet connection on your r36s.  

You can build a bunch of apps if you enable remote management on your r36s.  I recommend using https://github.com/dov/r36s-programming for how to do this.  Also cyberduck is a great tool for *finder*-like access to the files on the r36s.
